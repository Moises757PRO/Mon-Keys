# Mon-Keys
This is a Monkey that types random keys of your keyboard, for guess how to write a word!

## How?
1. Run the program with python(if you don\'t have Python install it, I recomend install the last vertion (; )
2. You need to write a word, for example: **missisipi**
3. Wait until was printed: \'proceed with **missisipi**(the word)\' and wait!
4. wait until says \'Founded! **missisipi**(the word)!\'
5. feel satisfied
6. share with friends
